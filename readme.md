# Geoserver: A front end starting point

This is a front end start point for a mapping application using [Geoserver](http://geoserver.org) as a back end. 

Primarily designed with GIS / Open geographic data in mind, the application allows you to configure a mapping application from one JSON file and set up overlays across a map.

Dependencies include
- [Geoserver](http://geoserver.org) - back end server and data provider, installed and configured seperately.
- [OpenLayers.js](http://openlayers.org) - a helper library for the mapping functions
- [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) - keeps things nice and tidy yet scalable
- [Inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com/) - a powerful, scalable, Sass-based, BEM, OOCSS framework.
